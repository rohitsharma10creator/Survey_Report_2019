## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
- The original data is 197MB, to download please go to [Stack Over Flow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and choose the dataset for 2019.    

- There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  This project is built using Anaconda 1.7.2, Python versions 3.6.3 and jupyter notebook 5.7.8.

- Libraries used:

    `pandas`

    `numpy`

    `matplotlib`

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. What are the distributions of women with respect to country, ethnicity, level of education, etc. in 2019?
2. What are the most popular types of development/languages among women in 2019?
3. What does the data suggest of man and woman in terms of salary and working hours? 
4. What factors associate with high salary, eg. type of development, education level, etc.?
5. Women with what skills earn more?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

- `stackoverflow_survey.ipynb`: showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

- `process.py`: runs the necessary code to process and prepare the data.
